    <h1 class="mainheader">About</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the official website for the DPHS Chapter of <a href="https://www.jsa.org/">JSA</a>! JSA is 
    an organization focused on politicizing high school students, and encouraging them to start contributing their thoughts
    to an increasingly polarized political arena. The mission statement, easily found on their 
    <a href="https://www.jsa.org/who-we-are/">website</a>, is as follows: "To strengthen American democracy 
    by educating and preparing high school students for life-long involvement and responsible leadership in a 
    democratic society." While this is obviously biased in favor of democracy, almost all political systems are self-propagating, 
    so this is no surprise. (Apologies to any supporters of dictatorships, anarchy, or any other non-democratic system)</p>
    <p>This website will also serve as a hub for the lightly affiliated Discord server, DSA. </p>

    <h1 class="mainheader">About JSA and DPHS</h1>
    <h2>DPHS</h2>
    <p>DPHS is a high school located in Santa Barbara, California. It is known in the area for being the host school of a locally
    famous Engineering Academy, and school's demographics are fairly diverse. Politically, while the neoliberal and Social Democrat 
    populations are the loudest and most well known, the school has a hefty conservative population, as well as silent underground 
    libertarian and anarchist (both left and right-wing) pools of thought. And of course, you will always find the occasional 
    totalitarian-lite or culturally right-wing extremist floating about.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Chapter</h2>
    <p>Our particular chapter had a rough start in the academic year 2019-2020. When the class of 2019 graduated, almost every member of
    JSA either left DPHS, graduated high school, or stopped attending the club, leaving the lone returning member to become club
    president. However, through hard work and tireless recruitment, he managed to assemble a skeletal crew which he could hold
    meetings with. The chapter finally started gaining notice when the progressive status quo was broken, and more and more
    people started to join the club. With the shutdown accompanying the Covid-19 approaching fast, a Discord server was formed,
    and with some decent recruiting work on the part of the exisiting members, the server expanded beyond DPHS and grew to become
    fairly active, keeping JSA alive while so many other clubs ceased to exist upon the start of the lockdown.
    <br><br>
    Now, we have solid ideological diversity, and the club's size upon the return to on-site school is thankfully, once again,
    enough to mark it as a solidly active organization.
