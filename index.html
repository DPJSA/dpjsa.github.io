    <h1 class="mainheader">About</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the official website for the DPHS Chapter of <a href="https://www.jsa.org/">JSA</a>! JSA is 
    an organization focused on politicizing high school students, and encouraging them to start contributing their thoughts
    to an increasingly polarized political arena. The mission statement, easily found on their 
    <a href="https://www.jsa.org/who-we-are/">website</a>, is as follows: "To strengthen American democracy 
    by educating and preparing high school students for life-long involvement and responsible leadership in a 
    democratic society." While this is obviously biased in favor of democracy, almost all political systems are self-propagating, 
    so this is no surprise. (Apologies to any supporters of dictatorships, anarchy, or any other non-democratic system)</p>
    <p>This website will also serve as a hub for the lightly affiliated Discord server, DSA. </p>

    <h1 class="mainheader">About JSA and DPHS</h1>
    <h2>DPHS</h2>
    <p>DPHS is a high school located in Santa Barbara, California. It is known in the area for being the host school of a locally
    famous Engineering Academy, and school's demographics are fairly diverse. Politically, while the neoliberal and Social Democrat 
    populations are the loudest and most well known, the school has a hefty conservative population, as well as silent underground 
    libertarian and anarchist (both left and right-wing) pools of thought. And of course, you will always find the occasional 
    totalitarian-lite or culturally right-wing extremist floating about.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Chapter</h2>
    <p>Our particular chapter had a rough start in the academic year 2019-2020. When the class of 2019 graduated, almost every member of
    JSA either left DPHS, graduated high school, or stopped attending the club, leaving the lone returning member to become club
    president. However, through hard work and tireless recruitment, he managed to assemble a skeletal crew which he could hold
    meetings with. The chapter finally started gaining notice when the progressive status quo was broken, and more and more
    people started to join the club. With the shutdown accompanying the Covid-19 approaching fast, a Discord server was formed,
    and with some decent recruiting work on the part of the exisiting members, the server expanded beyond DPHS and grew to become
    fairly active, keeping JSA alive while so many other clubs ceased to exist upon the start of the lockdown.
    <br><br>
    Now, we have solid ideological diversity, and the club's size upon the return to on-site school is thankfully, once again,
    enough to mark it as a solidly active organization.

    <h1 class="mainheader">About the DSA Server</h1>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The Discord server started off in February 2020. The members of the club were able to reach out beyond
      DPHS in order to recruit people (mainly high schoolers) from outside the school. Soon, weekly meetings were being held with fairly
      organized discussions. The server started out fairly left-leaning; there were a few communists, several progressives,
      and only one alt-righter and one libertarian to represent all of right-wing politics.<br><br>
      The different ideologues on the server came into conflict as well. Around March, the alt-righter
      began to post material which many members of the server thought was too bigoted to be allowed. A conflict which
      lasted for two weeks in March culminated in a new election and a compromise; a bigotry ban was implemented to ban
      bigoted trolling, but valid bigoted speech for the sake of discussion was still allowed. The alt-righter
      was unfortunately banned for trolling.<br><br>
      After this event, the server entered a golden age of peace, prosperity, and heated but relatively respectful
      discussion. For months, the server steadily recruited a flow of people; gaining new active members, but all
      the while increasing the chokehold of a monopoly leftist thought had on the server. But, sometime in July, a
      new reactionary anarcho-capitalist joined the server. He broke the bigoted trolling ban, but it was eventually
      agreed upon that he would receive a warning. The server enjoyed a couple days of uneasy peace, before the reactionary 
      took his thoughts a little too far in the eyes of the cultural far-left wingers on the server. Despite not breaking
      any rules, demands for his ban rose up, and this time, three of the most active members of the server decided to boycott
      it by leaving it, including a council member appointed by the President after their election.<br><br>
      Despite this, the remaining members of the server stand by their commitment to free speech and do not
      regret allowing the Hoppean to remain; as he has been one of the most active members during his time on.
    </p>
    <h2>Current</h2>
    <p>Despite missing 3 of the former core members, the server is still doing quite well. The ideological
      diversity is much more noticeable now, as despite losing two active communists, we still have multiple
      remaining active communists on the server. Additionally, those on the far cultural right can now speak
      their minds without fear of getting deplatformed. As always, we are looking for new members, and we
      have solid representation of both communism and capitalism, statism and anarchy, and culturally left and right-wing
      thought. If you appreciate free speech, please join!<br><br>
      DM the Director of Recruitment, Evan Davis, for a link to the server on his Instagram account, @lm93tah,
      unless otherwise specified by a server member.
