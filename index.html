    <p>Welcome to the official website for the DPHS Chapter of <a href="https://www.jsa.org/">JSA</a>! JSA is 
    an organization focused on politicizing high school students, and encouraging them to start contributing their thoughts
    to an increasingly polarized political arena. The mission statement, easily found on their 
    <a href="https://www.jsa.org/who-we-are/">website</a>, is as follows: "To strengthen American democracy 
    by educating and preparing high school students for life-long involvement and responsible leadership in a 
    democratic society."</p>
    <p>This website will also serve as a hub for the lightly affiliated Discord server, DSA. </p>
